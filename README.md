# Various-Coding-Things
Here we include a repository of functions and scripts which detail the foundational aspects of python, pandas, data and statistical analysis, etc. It's a one-stop shop for understanding how everything works, with applications to various interesting problems. We also look at numerical solutions in stochastic calculus, and anything else we find interesting.
